Welcome to biomass_sourcing!
============================
This is a repository for "Regionalized sourcing strategies of lignocellulose residues for a net-zero chemical industry" (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c03005). It allows the calculation of the availability of lignocellulosic residues in from 2000 to 2050 under two RCP scenarios (RCP1.9 and RCP6.5) at a resolution of 200 km x 200 km. It further allows to quantify the prospective environmental impacts of these lignocellulosic residues on the country level with life-cycle assessment (LCA).

The analysis is based on the Global Biosphere Management Model (GLOBIOM). The LCA part is based on the Brightway2 framework and the premise tool.

The repository contains the following files:
* `README.md`: This file
* `LICENSE`: The license file
* `environment.yml`: The conda environment file
* `main.py`: The Python script for running the analysis
* `data/`: The folder containing the data used for the analysis
* `src/`: The folder containing the source code of the analysis
* `figures/`: The folder containing the figures generated by the analysis

It further requires output data from GLOBIOM (in the `data/globiom/' folder).

For data requests, please contact the authors.

## Usage
To run the analysis, install conda environment using the `environment.yml` file. Then, run the script `main.py` in the root folder of the repository.
